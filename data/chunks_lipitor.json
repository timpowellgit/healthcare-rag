Extent  of  absorption  and  plasma  atorvastatin  concentrations  increases  in proportion to atorvastatin dose. Atorvastatin tablets are 95-99% bioavailable compared to solutions. The absolute bioavailability (parent drug) of atorvastatin is approximately 12% and the systemic availability of  HMG-CoA  reductase  inhibitory  activity  is  approximately  30%.  The  low  systemic  availability  is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa and/or first-pass metabolism in the liver. Although  food  decreases  the  rate  and  extent  of  drug  absorption  by  approximately  25%  and  9%,  as assessed  by  Cmax  and  AUC  respectively,  LDL-C  reduction  and  HDL-C  elevation  are  similar  when atorvastatin is given with and without food. Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following drug administration in the evening compared with morning dosing. However,  LDL-C  reduction  and  HDL-C  elevation  are  the  same  regardless  of  the  time  of  drug administration.\nDistribution: Mean volume of distribution of atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is \u2265 98%  bound  to  plasma  proteins.  A  blood/plasma  ratio  of  approximately  0.25  indicates  poor  drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk.\nMetabolism: Atorvastatin  is  extensively  metabolized  to  ortho-  and  para-hydroxylated  derivatives  by cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) and to various beta-oxidation products. In vitro, inhibition of HMGCoA  reductase  by  ortho-  and  para-hydroxylated  metabolites  is  equivalent  to  that  of  atorvastatin. Approximately  70%  of  circulating  inhibitory  activity  for  HMG-CoA  reductase  is  attributed  to  active metabolites. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.

Due to the small number of events, results for women were inconclusive.\nFigure 1: Effect of Atorvastatin Calcium 10 mg/day on Cumulative Incidence of Nonfatal Myocardial Infarction or Coronary Heart Disease Death (in ASCOT-LLA)\nIn the Collaborative AtoRvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the effect of atorvastatin calcium on coronary heart disease (CHD) and non-CHD endpoints was assessed in 2838 men (68%) and women (32%), ages 40-75 with type 2 diabetes based on WHO criteria, without prior history of cardiovascular disease and with LDL \u2264 4.14 mmol/L and TG \u2264 6.78 mmol/L. In addition to type 2 diabetes, subjects had one or more of the following CHD risk factors: current smoking (23%), hypertension (80%), retinopathy (30%), microalbuminuria (9%) or macroalbuminuria (3%). In this multicenter, placebocontrolled, double blind clinical trial of primary prevention of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in subjects with type 2 diabetes and 1 other CHD risk factor, patients were randomly allocated to either atorvastatin calcium 10 mg daily (1429) or placebo (1411) in a 1:1 ratio.",
