Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia.  Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin HCl is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. TEVA-METFORMIN treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age, unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as the patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking TEVA-METFORMIN and by use of the minimum effective dose of TEVA-METFORMIN. In addition, TEVAMETFORMIN should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, TEVA-METFORMIN should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking TEVA-METFORMIN (metformin HCl), since alcohol intake potentiates the effect of metformin HCl on lactate metabolism. In addition, TEVA-METFORMIN should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see PRECAUTIONS). The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and non-specific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistance bradyarrhyhmas with more marked acidosis.  The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see PRECAUTIONS). TEVA-METFORMIN should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified.",

When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 \u00b5g/mL are generally found.\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin HCl is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. TEVA-METFORMIN treatment should not be initiated in patients \u2265 80 years of age, unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as the patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking TEVA-METFORMIN and by use of the minimum effective dose of TEVA-METFORMIN. In addition, TEVAMETFORMIN should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, TEVA-METFORMIN should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking TEVA-METFORMIN (metformin HCl), since alcohol intake potentiates the effect of metformin HCl on lactate metabolism. In addition, TEVA-METFORMIN should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see PRECAUTIONS). The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and non-specific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistance bradyarrhyhmas with more marked acidosis.  The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see PRECAUTIONS). TEVA-METFORMIN should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified.",

Such an interaction has been observed between metformin and oral cimetidine in normal healthy volunteers in both single and multiple-dose, metformin-cimetidine drug interaction studies, with a 60 % increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and a 40 % increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC was observed. There was no change in elimination half-life in the single-dose study. Metformin had no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics. Therefore, careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of TEVA-METFORMIN or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via renal tubular secretion.",
